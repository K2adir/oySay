Vote Counter App for the upcoming elections in Turkey.

Designed for mobile use only.

Built with Vite, React, and SCSS. Icons are from React-icons.

Utilizes useContext and localStorage for state management and local storage persistence.

Includes a feature to take a screenshot within the app.

Users can enter the Ballot ID and School ID, which are saved locally.

On today's regular-sized screens, the full UI will be displayed. However, on older phones like iPhone 6-8, avatars are hidden.

The entire UI is implemented using flexbox and is responsive. Please note that this app is not optimized for desktop use. If it were designed for desktop, I would consider incorporating keyboard shortcuts for vote increment and decrement functionalities.

Problem: At the time of writing this, some desktop versions of Firefox have few pixels of alignment issues with the "VoteCounter" component. Other browsers are working fine. Since this isn't desinged for desktop, I will be waiting for the next firefox update.
