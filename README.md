# oySay
Vote Counter App for the upcoming elections in Turkey.

Designed for mobile use only.

Built with Vite, React, and SCSS. Icons are from React-icons.

Utilizes useContext and localStorage for state management and local storage persistence.

Includes a feature to take a screenshot within the app.

Users can enter the Ballot ID and School ID, which are saved locally.

On today's regular-sized screens, the full UI will be displayed. However, on older phones like iPhone 6-8, avatars are hidden.

The entire UI is implemented using flexbox and is responsive. Please note that this app is not optimized for desktop use. If it were designed for desktop, I would consider incorporating keyboard shortcuts for vote increment and decrement functionalities.
